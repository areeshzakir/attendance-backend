# Backend & Frontend Integration Task List

## 1. Google Sheets API Setup (Already Done)
- [x] Enable Google Sheets API in Google Cloud Console
- [x] Create a service account and download the JSON key
- [x] Share your Google Sheet with the service account email (Editor access)

## 2. Backend Development
- [x] Create a new project directory (e.g., `sheets-backend`)
- [x] Initialize Node.js project with `npm init -y`
- [x] Install dependencies: `express` and `googleapis`
- [x] Create `server.js` with:
  - [x] Google Sheets authentication using your JSON key
  - [x] API endpoint (e.g., `/data`) to fetch data from your sheet
- [ ] (Optional) Add more endpoints for updating/inserting data if needed
- [ ] Add your JSON key file to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive paths/IDs if deploying to production

## 3. Local Testing
- [x] Start the server: `node server.js`
- [x] Test the endpoint in your browser or with `curl`/Postman: `http://localhost:3000/data`
- [ ] Confirm you see your sheet data in JSON format

## 4. Frontend Integration
- [x] In your Bolt frontend, use `fetch('http://localhost:3000/data')` to get data
- [ ] Display the data in your dashboard as needed
- [ ] Confirm the frontend displays live data from your Google Sheet

## 5. Deployment
- [ ] Choose a deployment platform (Vercel, Render, Google Cloud, etc.)
- [ ] Update your backend code to use environment variables for secrets and IDs
- [ ] Ensure your JSON key is securely provided to the deployment environment
- [ ] Deploy your backend to your chosen platform
- [ ] Update the frontend fetch URL to your deployed backend's URL
- [ ] Visit your deployed backend's `/data` endpoint to confirm it works
- [ ] Confirm your frontend fetches and displays data from the deployed backend

## 6. (Optional) Enhancements
- [ ] Add more API endpoints (e.g., for updating or deleting sheet data)
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Add CORS support if your frontend and backend are on different domains
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for your backend

**Is this exhaustive?**
- This list covers all the essential steps for building a backend that connects to Google Sheets, exposes an API, connects to your frontend, and is ready for deployment.
- Optional enhancements are included for production-readiness and future growth.
- If you have custom business logic or additional features, you may need to add tasks specific to those requirements.
